        { q: "What is 'Alodine' or 'Chromating'?", options: ["A type of paint", "A chemical conversion coating for corrosion resistance", "A cleaning soap"], correct: 1, info: "Conversion coatings provide a thin layer of protection on bare aluminum." },
        { q: "High-solids paints are used because they...", options: ["Are cheap", "Have lower VOC emissions and better coverage", "Dry slower"], correct: 1, info: "High-solids paints are more environmentally friendly and durable." },
        { q: "What causes 'orange peel' in a paint finish?", options: ["Actual oranges", "Poor spray technique or incorrect thinning", "The sun"], correct: 1, info: "Orange peel is a texture defect where the paint doesn't flow out smoothly." },
        { q: "Why is paint stripped for major inspections?", options: ["To change the color", "To allow for crack and corrosion inspection of the skin", "To save weight only"], correct: 1, info: "Removing paint is the only way to reliably inspect the underlying metal." },
        { q: "What tool is used to measure paint thickness?", options: ["A ruler", "A dry film thickness (DFT) gauge", "A scale"], correct: 1, info: "DFT gauges use magnetism or eddy currents to measure the paint layer." },
        { q: "A 'Tack Rag' is used for...", options: ["Cleaning tools", "Removing dust from a surface just before painting", "Applying oil"], correct: 1, info: "Tack rags are sticky cloths that grab fine dust particles." },
        { q: "What does MEK stand for?", options: ["Methyl Ethyl Ketone", "Major Engineering Kit", "Metal Engine Key"], correct: 0, info: "MEK is a powerful solvent used for cleaning and adhesive removal." },
        { q: "Why are static ports masked before painting?", options: ["To keep them silver", "To prevent blockage which would crash the aircraft", "They don't need masking"], correct: 1, info: "Blocked static ports lead to incorrect airspeed and altitude readings." },
        { q: "What is 'Polyurethane' paint known for?", options: ["Being soft", "Extreme durability and chemical resistance", "Low cost"], correct: 1, info: "Polyurethane is the standard topcoat for its high gloss and toughness." },
        { q: "Surface preparation often involves 'scuff sanding' to...", options: ["Remove metal", "Provide a mechanical key for the new paint", "Clean dirt"], correct: 1, info: "Sanding creates microscopic scratches that the paint can hold onto." },
        { q: "What is the 'Pot Life' of a two-part paint?", options: ["The life of the bucket", "The time the mixed paint remains usable", "The time it takes to dry"], correct: 1, info: "Once mixed, chemical curing starts; you must use the paint before it hardens in the gun." },
        { q: "Water-break tests are used to check for...", options: ["Leaks", "Surface cleanliness/grease presence", "Paint dryness"], correct: 1, info: "If water beads up, the surface is still contaminated with oil or grease." },
        { q: "Which organization regulates the disposal of paint waste?", options: ["The Pilot", "Environmental agencies (like the EPA)", "The Stores"], correct: 1, info: "Paint and solvents are hazardous waste and must be disposed of legally." },
        { q: "What is the purpose of the 'wash primer'?", options: ["To wash the aircraft", "To provide a very thin etch-prime layer on bare metal", "To replace the topcoat"], correct: 1, info: "Wash primers use acid to etch the surface for maximum adhesion." }
